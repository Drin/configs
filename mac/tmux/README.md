# Overview

This directory is for all of my tmux configuration, since I want to actually setup my terminal the
way I want it now. Mainly, I am making this README to note where I got the tmux theme (even though
it is relatively self explanatory).

# Configuration

## [Nord Theme][theme-nord]

The nord theme is really nice, and makes the tmux status bar tolerable. Byobu's default style is
nice, but nord is next level.
