# Overview
Various configuration files I've picked up for:
* terminal emulators
* command line shells
* window managers
* etc.

This repository is useful for:
* consistency across devices
* being able to rollback any updates that clobber configuration
* remembering configurations for technologies I moved away from
* "easily" setting up new devices

# Current Environment(s)
I am currently enjoying:
* [i3 wm][i3wm]

* [fish][fish-shell]
